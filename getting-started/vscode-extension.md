# VSCode Extension
You can use a Visual Studio Code extension to make creating and checking your Flarial Scripting easier. As of now, we don't have anything on the marketplace, however you can build a current version of the extension to use right now!

### Github Installation
:::warning
This guide is using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager), which can be downloaded and installed easily!
:::

- If you go to this [repo](https://github.com/flarialmc/scripting-vscode-extension), the source code for the extension is held here. You can download this easily by doing this.
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/flarialmc/scripting-vscode-extension.git
  ```
- Once you have it downloaded, you will want to go to the source code, and:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- Once, the dependencies for the repo are installed, you will want to install ```vcse``` globally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @vscode/vsce
  ```
- Then simply run,
  ```bash
  vsce package
  ```
- Once you get your .vsix file you will want to do (replacing "flarial" with the name of the .vsix outputted):
  ```bash
  code --install-extension flarial.vsix
  ```

ðŸŽ‰ Congrats, you've done it. Now when you open a Lua file to make scripting for Flarial Client, you'll be able to make valid scripting much easier.
:::tip
This is why, we recommended Visual Studio Code, but you do not need this IDE or this extension to code a script for Flarial Client; these just make it easier.
